<p>WP Nearby Places lets you easily create Google maps for your WordPress website with your specified location at its center. Website visitors will have the ability to quickly search what's around your specified location like no other mapping plugin that uses the power of Google maps. WP Nearby Places also uniquely breaks down neighborhood locations by categories, such as Restaurants, Parks, Police and, depending which version you purchase, provides the location's name, address, URL, website address, phone number and distance (in miles or kilometers) from the central location.</p><p> There are 2 versions available: Basic (which is free and available through WordPress.org) and Premium (which is offered here). For details about all our licensed versions available, including our exciting Add-ons, go to https://members.wpnearbyplaces.com/shop.</p>
